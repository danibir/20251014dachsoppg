Saturn's rings are believed to have formed over 100 million years ago, possibly from remnants of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that ventured too close to the planet's strong gravitational pull. The rings are primarily composed of countless particles of ice, with a smaller fraction of rocky debris and dust. These particles range in size from tiny grains to chunks several meters across. The high reflectivity of ice gives the rings their bright, shimmering appearance, making them visible even from Earth with telescopes.
