The most detailed observations of Saturn's rings come from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017. Cassini's instruments provided high-resolution images and data, revealing the rings' complex structure, composition, and behavior over time. These findings have deepened our understanding of the rings' origins, lifespan, and the processes shaping them.
