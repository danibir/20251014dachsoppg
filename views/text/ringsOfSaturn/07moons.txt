Saturn's rings are not static; they are dynamic and constantly evolving. Several small moons, known as shepherd moons, help maintain the structure of the rings by gravitationally confining ring particles and creating sharp edges and gaps. For example, the moons Prometheus and Pandora shepherd the F ring, giving it a braided appearance.

The interactions between the rings and these moons lead to fascinating phenomena such as ringlets, waves, and edges that ripple with gravitational influence. These interactions demonstrate the delicate balance of forces shaping the rings' intricate structures.
